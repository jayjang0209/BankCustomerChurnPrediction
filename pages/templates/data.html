                <h3>Problem Definition</h3>
                <p>Banks are constantly looking for ways to improve their customer service and retain their customers.
                    Losing customers can be expensive for banks as they need to spend resources on acquiring new
                    customers to replace those who have left. By predicting which customers are likely to leave, banks
                    can take proactive measures to retain these customers. This can include offering incentives,
                    providing personalized services, or addressing any concerns that the customer may have. Ultimately,
                    retaining customers can help banks to maintain their market position, increase their revenue, and
                    improve their overall profitability.</p>
                <h3 class="mt-5">Goal of the project</h3>
                <p>The aim of this project is to develop a model to predict whether a bank's customer will leave the
                    bank or not, based on various features such as age, gender, balance, etc. This prediction can help
                    banks to identify customers who are likely to exit, allowing them to take appropriate measures to
                    retain these customers. Retaining customers is important for banks as it can help them to maintain
                    their customer base, reduce costs associated with acquiring new customers, and ultimately increase
                    their revenue.</p>
                <h3 class="mt-5">Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>
                <p>Data has 10000 entries and consist of 11 numeric variables and 3 non-numeric variables.</p>
                <h5>Most significant feature selection</h5>
                <p>The main goal of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is to understand the data, identify patterns,
                    relationships, and anomalies, and generate insights that can be used to inform further analysis. EDA
                    helps to uncover important features, identify data quality issues, and understand the distribution
                    of the data.</p>
                <p>To identify the most important features, This project uses “SelectKBest” to find the top 6
                    significant features.</p>
                <p>Total six significant features are identified as below:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Age: This feature is important as younger customers are more likely to switch banks as compared
                        to older customers who have built a long-term relationship with the bank.</li>
                    <li>IsActiveMember: Customers who are actively engaged with the bank, such as using their products
                        and services, are less likely to leave. Therefore, this feature can be useful in predicting
                        whether a customer is likely to abandon or not.</li>
                    <li>Gender_Male, Gender_Female: Gender can also be an important factor as males and females might
                        have different banking behavior and preferences.</li>
                    <li>Balance: Customers with higher balances are less likely to leave the bank as they have a greater
                        investment in the bank.</li>
                    <li>NumOfProducts: This feature is useful as customers who use more products of the bank are more
                        likely to stay as compared to those who use only a few products.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Therefore, these features are considered significant as they can help in predicting the likelihood of
                    a customer leaving the bank and can be used by the bank to take actions to retain its customers.</p>

        <h3>Correlation Heatmap for numeric variables</h3>
        <p>A correlation heatmap is a type of visual representation that is commonly used to display the
            correlation between two or more numeric variables. It is a matrix that displays the correlation coefficient
            between pairs of variables in a dataset, with the color of each cell representing the strength of the
            correlation.</p>

        <p>I performed data treatment by getting dummy variables for categorical columns (Gender). I
            dropped columns that are not needed for modeling (Exited, RowNumber, CustomerId, Surname, and Geography). I
            scaled the data using StandardScaler.</p>
        <p>The data used in this report underwent several treatments to ensure it was suitable for modeling as below:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Split the dataset into train.csv(70%) and test.csv(30%)</li>
            <li>Drop the columns that are not related to the target variable 'RowNumber', “CustomerId”, “Surname”,
                “Geography”</li>
            <li>Create Dummies variables for the 1 categorical variables: “Gender”</li>
            <li>Data scaling to improve the model’s performance (StandardScaler)</li>

                    then loaded the saved model and evaluated it using appropriate metrics (classification_report and

                    running GridSearchCV, the best parameters were identified as: solver='adam',
                    learning_rate='invscaling', hidden_layer_sizes=(150, 150), early_stopping=True, and
                    activation='relu'. I then used the new model to predict the test data and evaluated it using
